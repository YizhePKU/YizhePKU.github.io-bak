# Misc Gotchas

* `np.sum()` by default reduces the entire array to a scalar; specify `axis=0` to operate on the first axis only.

* `np.dot()`, `np.inner()`, `np.outer()`, `np.matmul()`
  * `np.matmul()` is probably the most useful -- `a @ b` works as you expect when `a` and `b` are vectors or matrices.
  * `np.inner()` only operates on the inner most axis
  * `np.outer()` flattens its inputs and always produces a matrix
  * `np.dot()` is mostly outclassed by `np.matmul()`
