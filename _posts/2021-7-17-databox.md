Idea: simple data version control, subset of dvc

* `dvc init` -- creates .dvc

* `dvc add` -- add a directory for monitoring

* `dvc freeze` -- commit all files and link them to .dvc/cache 
  * Use hard-links to avoid copying files
  * After freeze, files are immutable but can be deleted
* `dvc checkout` -- switch to a frozen version of files



Reflinks are copy-on-write hard links. Not supported on ext4 though.

Can we utilize btrfs and FUSE?

* Possible, but too hard to implement
